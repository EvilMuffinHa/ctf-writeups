The name implies Caesar, but the challenge provides a key.  
Searching up "Keyed Ceasar" brings up [this site](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/caesar-keyed.php).  
By using this site, plugging in the ciphertext `agqr{yue_stdcgciup_padas}` and the key `ANGSTROMCTF`
and setting the mode to `decrypt`, the flag is revealed.
